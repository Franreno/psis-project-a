Everytime there is a change in the structure of the board, we should send a update field to the publisher.
The display should only know about the matrix, it does not need to know about the statuses of the other players.
This would envolve sending an update each time the position was updated.

What are some possible places to send this update?

- A thing is drawn on the board.
- A thing is removed from the board.
- A score is updated.

The structure of field update should have an array of changed cells. 
This changed cells should have its information about the stack. Basically it should "overwrite" the stack when it receives 
one from the publisher.
Also it should include a update of lizard scores. This means receiving a list of scores. These are the only things that the 
display should know about the server.
Certainly this would envolve sending the complete structure of the window for the first time.

TODO:

[X] Implement the new strucutre for the field update
[] Implement a way to know which cells were updated in this cycle. 
   Maybe have a field on the matrix itself to include a list of indexes that were udpated.
[] Implement mechanism to include the lizard scores
[X] Implement send mechanism of the updated values
[X] Implement the protobuf mechanism
[] Implement the zeromq sending mechanism
