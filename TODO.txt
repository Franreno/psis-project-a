Mudar o nome de "Display-app" para "display-app" para os nomes dos ficheiros serem lowercase?

Mudar o nome de "remote-char.h# para outro nome mais indicativo do que o ".h" serve?

Corrigir o DEFAULT_SERVER_ADDRESS para funcionar sem workaround

Spawns só devem acontecer em espaços vazios

Server pode apresentar a board usando também a Display-app

The lizardsNroaches-server and Display-app should also display the game status, i.e. the scores of all lizards.

Não sei se as dimensões do mapa são necessáriamente simétricas!

Para aumentar segurança de comunicação, os clients podem usar hash para comunicar em vez de id dos arrays


RULES:

-> When a lizard rams another one the head of both lizards is equalized to the average of their respective scores

-> When a lizard moves on top of a roach (or roaches), its score increases by the value of the ingested roach (or roaches)

-> Roaches, can stack, when ingested, all stacked roaches are ingested

-> When ingested, roaches should disapear for 5 seconds, after which, they should reaper in a random spot on the map

-> Cockroaches can move to the same place of other cockroaches, can be below or on top the body of lizards, but can not move to the head of the lizards.

-> The head of the lizards cannot share a position with any other lizard’s head

-> When a lizard reaches a score 0f fifty (50) it winsand its body starts to be draw with *

At every movement, we need to send the movement that happened
also send the updated score,
and also send the eaten roaches state. 


// For the roaches, we could send that there was a movement of the roach to out of the screen. But we also need to remove it from the stack...
// Publish two movements? In a way, the roach was moved out of the board, therefore we could warn the displays about this
