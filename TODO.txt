TODO


When a Lizard reaches a negative score, the body should disappear and only the head is drawn - This is not working correctly, the tail disappears but then appears again after movement, maybe it needs an extra flag on the lizard structure

A Lizard tail is drawn over a wasp - should be just a matter of fixing the order of display

Change the number of slots for roaches and slots for wasps to be shared and not independent

DONE <- Spawns for lizards and roaches now need to check for the possibility of wasps too

Wasp movement for when a lizard is hit should decrease their score - It should be working for when a lizard moves on top of a wasp, but it's not implemented for when a wasp moves on top of a lizard because it doesn't have access to the lizard_payload

Introduce fix for out of order disconnects for roach and wasps clients - Already implemented for lizard clients

Remove display-app and move it's implementation to the lizard-client

Introduce timeout to all types of clients if they fail to communicate with the server after 1 minute, after that the client should be notified that the messages are invalid if he tries to send them again - Maybe it could be done with timestamps

Implement multithreading server side - 4 threads for handling messages from all the Lizard_clientâ€™s and 1 thread for handling messages from the Roaches-client's or Wasps-client's

Error treatment and cheating prevention

DONE <- Use protocol buffers for message encoding
